# Network Fundamentals Guide

# Introduction to Networking

A computer network is a system where multiple computing devices, often called nodes, are linked together for the purpose of communication, collaboration, and resource sharing. Networks enable devices like computers, servers, smartphones, and IoT devices to exchange data and access shared resources such as printers, storage, and internet services. To achieve this, networks rely on communication protocols—standardized rules and conventions that ensure devices can understand each other regardless of manufacturer or underlying hardware.

Networking can be established via wired connections (Ethernet, fiber optics) that provide stability and high speed, or wireless connections (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, satellite) that offer mobility and convenience. Networks are the foundation of the modern digital world, supporting everything from personal messaging apps to global-scale cloud services.

## Key Networking Concepts

### Network Types by Scale

- **Personal Area Network (PAN):** The smallest type of network, PANs typically connect devices within a few meters—such as smartphones, laptops, wearables, and printers. Bluetooth and infrared are most common. Examples: syncing a smartwatch to a phone, or connecting wireless earbuds.
- **Local Area Network (LAN):** LANs cover limited areas like homes, offices, schools, or data centers. They are widely used to interconnect devices for file sharing, local gaming, or centralized network printing. Ethernet cables and Wi-Fi form the backbone of LANs. Characteristics include high speed (up to gigabits per second) and private ownership.
- **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):** Larger than LANs, they usually connect multiple LANs across a city or metropolitan region. Examples: city-wide government, university networks, or large business campuses. Technologies like Metro Ethernet and fiber optics are commonly used.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN):** WANs extend over large distances, often spanning multiple countries and continents. The most famous example is the Internet itself. WANs use routers and leased telecommunication lines to interconnect smaller networks. They emphasize scalability, reliability, and long-distance data transport.

### Network Topologies

Network topology refers to the arrangement of elements within a network. The layout of connections between nodes influences performance, fault tolerance, and ease of troubleshooting.

- Physical Topologies
    - **Bus:** A single backbone cable connects all devices. Cheap and simple, but if the backbone fails, the network collapses. Rare in modern use.
    - **Ring:** Devices form a circle, with each device connected to two others. Data travels in one direction. Provides equal data access but is vulnerable if one node fails.
    - **Star:** Each device connects to a central hub or switch. Failure of one node does not affect others, but the hub is a single point of failure. Widely used in Ethernet LANs.
    - **Mesh:** Every node connects to multiple others. Offers high redundancy and reliability but is expensive and complex. Used in mission-critical and military applications.
    - **Tree/Hierarchical:** A layered star-like structure. Found in large organizations and ISPs with structured branching.
    - **Hybrid:** Combination of two or more topologies, allowing flexible deployment in enterprise systems.

## The OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system.  The OSI model is a **seven-layer abstraction** that standardizes how data travels over a network. Each layer handles a specific part of the communication process and interacts only with its adjacent layers.

1. **Physical:** Deals with cables, connectors, signaling (1s and 0s as electrical or optical signals). E.g., Ethernet cabling, fiber optics.
2. **Data Link:** Provides node-to-node reliability and error detection. Uses MAC addresses. E.g., Ethernet, PPP, Wi-Fi.
3. **Network:** Responsible for logical addressing and routing packets. E.g., IP, ICMP.
4. **Transport:** End-to-end communication, ensures reliability, sequencing, and flow control. E.g., TCP, UDP.
5. **Session:** Manages sessions between applications, handling start/stop of communication. E.g., NetBIOS, RPC.
6. **Presentation:** Data formatting, encryption, and compression for interoperability between systems. E.g., SSL/TLS, JPEG.
7. **Application:** Supports user-facing services such as email, web browsing, and file transfer. E.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP.

| **Layer** | **Name** | **Function** | **Examples** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | Application | User interface and application access | HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS |
| 6 | Presentation | Data translation, encryption, compression | SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG |
| 5 | Session | Establishes, manages, and terminates connections | NetBIOS, RPC |
| 4 | Transport | End-to-end connections, reliability, flow control | TCP, UDP |
| 3 | Network | Logical addressing and routing | IP, ICMP, routing protocols |
| 2 | Data Link | Physical addressing and media access | Ethernet, MAC, PPP |
| 1 | Physical | Transmission of raw bit streams | Cables, hubs, repeaters |

## TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP model is a more practical, condensed version of the OSI model, used in real-world network implementations. Unlike the OSI model, the TCP/IP model is implementation-driven and forms the foundation of today’s Internet:

- **Application Layer:** Combines OSI layers 5–7. Supports high-level protocols (HTTP, FTP, DNS).
- **Transport Layer:** Provides communication services like TCP (reliable) or UDP (fast but unreliable).
- **Internet Layer:** Equivalent to OSI’s Network Layer. Routing with IP and ICMP happens here.
- **Network Interface Layer:** Covers OSI layers 1–2, dealing with hardware addressing and data framing.

| **Layer** | **Equivalent OSI Layers** | **Protocols/Functions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application | 5-7 (Session, Presentation, Application) | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, Telnet |
| Transport | 4 (Transport) | TCP, UDP |
| Internet | 3 (Network) | IP, ICMP, ARP, IGMP |
| Network Interface | 1-2 (Physical, Data Link) | Ethernet, Token Ring, PPP |

# Network Addressing

## IP Addressing

IP addresses uniquely identify devices on a network. There are two main versions in use:

### IPv4

- Most widely deployed, with a 32-bit address scheme producing ~4.3B unique addresses. Structured into classes (A, B, C). Uses subnet masks to divide networks. Example: home router IP 192.168.0.1.
- **Format:** 32-bit address written as four decimal numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- **Address Space:** Approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.
- **Classes:** Traditionally divided into classes A, B, C, D, and E.
- **Subnetting:** Process of dividing a network into smaller networks using subnet masks.

### IPv6

- Developed to overcome IPv4 exhaustion. Uses 128-bit addresses for enormous address space (2^128). Features auto-configuration, stronger security, and better routing efficiency. Example: 2001:0db8::1.
- **Format:** 128-bit address written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
- **Address Space:** 2^128 addresses (340 undecillion).
- **Features:** Auto-configuration, simplified header, improved security, and better multicast support.

## MAC Addressing

Media Access Control (MAC) addresses are hardware addresses uniquely identifying each device on a network. Unlike IP, which is logical and reconfigurable, a MAC address is a *hardware-embedded unique identifier* for network adapters. Used within a LAN for device recognition. Format is hex notation (00:1A:7D:9B:2F:3B).

- **Format:** 48-bit address typically written as six groups of two hexadecimal digits (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).
- **Assignment:** Assigned by manufacturers and should be globally unique.

# Core Network Protocols

- **TCP:** Reliable, connection-oriented protocol. Provides sequence numbers, error correction, and flow control. The famous **Three-Way Handshake** (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) establishes connections. Used for web, email, file transfers.
- **UDP:** Connectionless, faster, lightweight, but unreliable. Suited for real-time apps like video calls, gaming, DNS queries.
- **IP:** Manages addressing and routing packets between networks. Works on a “best-effort” delivery system.
- **ICMP:** Vital for error handling and diagnostics (used in ping and traceroute).
- **ARP:** Maps logical IP addresses to hardware MAC addresses on local networks.

## Transport Layer Protocols

### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

- **Connection-oriented:** Establishes a connection before transmitting data.
- **Reliable:** Ensures data delivery through acknowledgments and retransmissions.
- **Flow Control:** Prevents overwhelming receivers with too much data.
- **Congestion Control:** Adjusts to network congestion.
- **Use Cases:** Web browsing (HTTP), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP).
- TCP Three-Way Handshake Process
    1. Client sends SYN packet to server.
    2. Server responds with SYN-ACK packet.
    3. Client sends ACK packet, establishing the connection.

### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

- **Unreliable:** No guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal overhead and latency.
- **Use Cases:** Streaming media, online gaming, DNS lookups.

## Internet Layer Protocols

### Internet Protocol (IP)

# Routing and Switching

- **Switching:** Decides how frames travel within LANs. Store-and-forward switching ensures error checking, cut-through switching boosts performance, and fragment-free switching balances both.
- **Routing:** Involves IP-level decision making to direct packets efficiently. Routers build **routing tables** using metrics like hop count or bandwidth. Protocols include RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, and BGP (for inter-domain Internet routing).

## Switching Methods

- **Store-and-Forward:** Switch receives entire frame before forwarding, can check for errors.
